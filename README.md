**Finance-Tracker**

_**Functionalities:**_
Reads debit card statements, cleans them and automatically creates a SQL server that continuously fetches the clean data and supplies it to PowerBI for visualization. Hosted on a streamlit app.

A user can select 2 options, the first one fetches the powerbi report from the powerbi server and the second one reads and cleans the bank statement by running excel macros and python code.
